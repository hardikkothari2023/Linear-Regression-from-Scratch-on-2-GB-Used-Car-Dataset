# Linear Regression from Scratch on Used Car Dataset
Developed a Linear Regression model from scratch to predict car prices using a dataset with 426,880 records and 25 input features.
Preprocessed extensive data with tools like Pandas and NumPy, handling missing values and optimizing for efficient processing.
Implemented core Linear Regression algorithms, including manual derivation and application of the normal equation and gradient descent.
Conducted in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualized key trends in the dataset using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Validated the modelâ€™s performance with metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared to ensure accuracy and robustness.
Authored clear and detailed documentation to guide users in replicating and extending the project.
